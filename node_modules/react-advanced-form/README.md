[React Advanced Form](https://github.com/kettanaito/react-advanced-form) is a library for tailoring real-world forms in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with pleasure and ease.

# Features

- **Expectations shift**. Trust and expect a form to do more than just rendering the fields. Our features are designed to handle cumbersome use cases with clean and performant code.
- **Immutable**. Each interaction or update is a pure function that produces the next state of a field. Immutability is a must in any decent implementation.
- [**Composite fields**](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/getting-started/creating-fields). React Advanced Form is _field-centric_. That means you define flexible fields composites and reuse them throughout the application. Reflect even the most granular field state changes in the UI to achieve the outmost user experience.
- [**Clean and fast**](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/getting-started/creating-form). Develop production-ready forms in a speed of a prototype.

```jsx
// This is not a diminished example, this is a finite form
<Form action={this.registerUser}>
  <Input name="username" required />
  <Input name="password" type="password" required />
</Form>
```

- [**Layered validation schema**](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/validation/getting-started). Declare validation rules of any complexity using pure single-line resolvers.

```javascript
export default {
  type: {
    password: {
      capitalLetter: ({ value }) => /[A-Z]/.test(value),
      oneNumber: ({ value }) => /[0-9]/.test(value),
    },
  },
  name: {
    confirmPassword: ({ get, value }) => {
      /**
       * The "confirmPassword" field will be re-validated whenever
       * the "value" prop of "userPassword" field updates.
       */
      return value === get(['userPassword', 'value'])
    },
  },
}
```

Access the field's `value`, `fieldProps`, and the `form` as the parameters of each resolver function. Apply the rules application-wide via [`FormProvider`](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/components/form-provider), or extend/override them for a specific form. **Say goodbye to crowded** `validate` **functions, welcome clean validation schemas**!

- [**Reactive props**](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/architecture/reactive-props). How much effort would it take you to make one field required based on another field\(s\)? Yes, the correct answer isâ€”_one line of code_:

```jsx
<Input
  name="firstName"
  required={({ get }) => !!get(['lastName', 'value'])} />
<Input
  name="lastName"
  required={({ get }) => !!get(['firstName', 'value'])} />
```

Get as many data from the sibling fields as needed, and build your logic around that. Rely on reactive programming that will re-evaluate a resolver function whenever the referenced field props update.

- [**Field grouping**](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/components/field-group). Control the serialized data structure on the layout level by grouping the fields. Take advantage of nested and split groups.

```jsx
<Input name="companyName" value="Google" />

<Field.Group name="billingAddress">
  <Input name="firstName" value="John" />
  <Input name="lastName" value="Maverick" />
</Field.Group>

<Checkbox name="termsAndConditions" checked />

<Field.Group name="deliveryAddress">
  <Input name="firstName" value="Catheline" />
  <Input name="lastName" value="McCoy" />
</Field.Group>
```

The layout above serializes into the following JSON:

```javascript
{
  "companyName": "Google",
  "billingAddress": {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Maverick"
  },
  "termsAndConditions": true,
  "deliveryAddress": {
    "firstName": "Catheline",
    "lastName": "McCoy"
  }
}
```

- **Third-party fields support**. React Advanced Form can be used with **any** third-party fields library by using powerful [`createField`](https://redd.gitbook.io/react-advanced-form/hoc/create-field) API.
